# SpringSecurity
 
This project is a learning exercise for Spring Security and JWT authentication. The project is built using Spring Boot/Java/Spring Security for the backend, while the frontend is built with Angular.

The project currently supports token based authentication using JWTs.

TO DO:
1. Add content that users can interact with in some way (CRUD) based on their roles and authorities.
2. Add ability to add posts and comments
3. Allow admins/moderators to lock/delete posts

Done:

~~Add the ability to register a new user and send an email in the backend.~~

~~Finish creating forms to sign up and sign in (with validation).~~

~~Add restrictions based on the user's role in the frontend (and whether the user is a guest or logged in). Research Guards.~~
