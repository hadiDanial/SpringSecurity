# SpringSecurity
 
This project is a learning exercise for Spring Security and JWT authentication. The project is built using Spring Boot/Java/Spring Security for the backend, while the frontend is built with Angular.

The project currently supports token based authentication using JWTs.

TO DO:
1. Finish creating forms to sign up and sign in (with validation).
2. Add the ability to register a new user and send an email in the backend.
3. Add restrictions based on the user's role in the frontend (and whether the user is a guest or logged in). Research Guards.
4. Add content that users can interact with in some way (CRUD) based on their roles and authorities.
